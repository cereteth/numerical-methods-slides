\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item recall linear algebra {\tiny{ouch!}}
  \item cost analysis of basic operations
  \item identify basic solution schemes to systems
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -------------------------------------------------
% -------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why this is important:}
\begin{itemize} 
  \item matrix problems arise in many areas of CS (information sciences,
graphics, design, etc)
  \item Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) is an interface standard for
operations
  \item simple systems set the stage for further development: avoiding error,
avoiding large costs
\end{itemize}

  \begin{alertblock}{Prereq}
    Linear Algebra is a prerequisite of the course!
  \end{alertblock}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item you should feel comfortable with Appendix D.1 in NMC6
  \item Appendix D.2 in NMC6 should not be a surprise
  \item look at Lecture 5a notes
  \end{itemize}

\frametitle{Matrix Inverse}

Let $A$ be a square (i.e. \matdim{n}{n}) with real elements.  The
\emph{inverse} of $A$ is designated $A^{-1}$, and has the property that
\begin{equation*}
    A^{-1}\, A = I
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \ \
    A\, A^{-1} = I
\end{equation*}

The \textbf{formal solution} to $Ax=b$ is $x=A^{-1}b$.
\begin{align*}
              Ax &= b     \\
    A^{-1}\, A x &= A^{-1}b  \\
              Ix &= A^{-1}b   \\
               x &= A^{-1}b
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> formal solution to $Ax=b$ is $x=A^{-1}b$
\item<2-> BUT it is \emph{bad} evaluate $x$ this way
\item<3-> why?
\item<4-> we will not form $A^{-1}$, but solve for $x$ directly using
Gaussian elimination.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Why do we care as Numerical Analysts?}

Open questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How \emph{expensive} is it to solve $Ax=b$?
  \item What problems (errors) will we encounter solving $Ax=b$?
  \item Some matrices are easy/cheap to use: diagonal, tridiagonal, etc.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item are there others?  what makes something a "good" matrix
      numerically?
      \item are there bad ones?  how do we identify them numerically?
    \end{itemize}
  \item what do actual numerical analysts, engineers, developers, etc
  use?!?!

\frametitle{Formal Solution when $A$ is \matdim{n}{n}}


The \emph{formal solution} to $Ax=b$ is
\begin{equation*}
        x = A^{-1}b
\end{equation*}
where $A$ is \matdim{n}{n}.

If $A^{-1}$ exists then $A$ is said to be \textbf{nonsingular}.

If $A^{-1}$ does not exist then $A$ is said to be \textbf{singular}.

\frametitle{Singularity of $A$}

If an \matdim{n}{n} matrix, $A$, is \textbf{singular} then
\begin{itemize}
    \item   the columns of $A$ are linearly dependent
    \item   the rows of $A$ are linearly dependent
    \item   $\rank{A}<n$
    \item   $\det(A)=0$
    \item   $A^{-1}$ does not exist
    \item   a solution to $Ax=b$ may not exist

\frametitle{Summary of Requirements for Solution of $Ax=b$}

Given the \matdim{n}{n} matrix $A$ and the \matdim{n}{1} vector, $b$
\begin{itemize}
    \item   the solution to $Ax=b$ exists and is unique for any $b$
            if and only if $\rank{A}=n$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{}
Recall: rank $=$ \# of linearly independent rows or columns

Recall: $Range(A) =$ set of vectors $y$ such that $Ax=y$ for some $x$

\begin{equation*}
Ax=b

Three situations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ is nonsingular: There exists a unique solution $x=A^{-1} b$

  \item $A$ is singular and $b \in Range(A)$: There are infinite solutions.

  \item $A$ is singular and $b \notin Range(A)$: There no solutions.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
$A=\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&4\\\end{bmatrix}$
$b=\begin{bmatrix}1\\8\\\end{bmatrix}$, then
$x=\begin{bmatrix}1/2\\2\\\end{bmatrix}$.

  \item 
$A=\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&0\\\end{bmatrix}$
$b=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\\end{bmatrix}$, then infinitely many solutions.
$x=\begin{bmatrix}1/2\\\alpha\\\end{bmatrix}$.

  \item 
$A=\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&0\\\end{bmatrix}$
$b=\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}$, then no solutions.

The generic lower and upper triangular matrices are
\begin{equation*}
    L = \begin{bmatrix} l_{11} &   0    & \cdots &   0    \\
                        l_{21} & l_{22} &        &   0    \\
                        \vdots &        & \ddots & \vdots \\
                        l_{n1} &        & \cdots & l_{nn} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    U = \begin{bmatrix} u_{11} & u_{12} & \cdots & u_{1n} \\
                           0   & u_{22} &        & u_{2n}  \\
                        \vdots &        & \ddots & \vdots \\
                           0   &        & \cdots & u_{nn} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The triangular systems
\begin{equation*}
    Ly = b \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Ux = c
\end{equation*}
are easily solved by \textbf{forward substitution} and
\textbf{backward substitution}, respectively

Solving for $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$
for a lower triangular system is called \textbf{forward substitution}.
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape,caption=,label=algo:forsub]
  given $L$, $b$               
  $x_1 = b_1/\ell_{11}$           
  for $i=2\ldots n$          
    $s = b_i$                  
    for $j = 1\ldots i-1$    
      $s = s - \ell_{i,j}x_j$   
    end                      
    $x_i = s/\ell_{i,i}$
