\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $e_n = x^* - x_n$ be the error.
  \item In general, a sequence is said to converge with rate $r$ if
    \begin{equation*}
      \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty} \frac{|e_{n+1}|}{|e_{n}|^{r}} = C
    \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Special Cases:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If $r=1$ and $C=1$, then the rate is \emph{sublinear}
  \item If $r=1$ and $C<1$, then the rate is \emph{linear}
  \item If $r>1$ (i.e. $r=1$ and $C=0$), then the rate is \emph{superlinear}
  \item If $r=2$ and $C>0$, then the rate is \emph{quadratic}
  \item If $r=3$ and $C>0$, then the rate is \emph{cubic}

\frametitle{Newton's Method: Convergence}
\begin{block}{Recall}
  Convergence of a method is said to be of order $r$ if there is a
constant $C>0$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{|e_{k+1}|}{|e_k|^r} = C
\end{equation*}
\end{block}
Newton's method is of order 2 (quadratic) when $f'(x_{*}) \ne 0$.
\bigskip
For $\xi$ between $x_k$ and $x_{*}$
\begin{equation*}
  f(x_{*}) = f(x_k) + (x_{*}-x_k)f'(x_k) + \frac{1}{2}(x_{*}-x_k)^2 f''(\xi) = 0
\end{equation*}
So
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)} + x_{*}-x_k + (x_{*}-x_k)^2 \frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_k)} = 0
\end{equation*}
Then
\begin{equation*}
  \left(\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)} -x_k\right)+ x_{*} + (x_{*}-x_k)^2 \frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_k)} = 0
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  x_{*}-x_{k+1} + (x_{*}-x_k)^2 \frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_k)} = 0
\end{equation*}
Thus
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\left|x_{*}-x_{k+1}\right|}{\left|x_{*}-x_k\right|^2}  = \left|\frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_k)}\right|
\end{equation*}

Given two guesses $x_{k-1}$ and $x_k$, the next guess at the root
is where the line through $f(x_{k-1})$ and $f(x_k)$
crosses the $x$ axis.

Given
\begin{align*}
    x_k     &= \mathrm{current\ guess\ at\ the\ root}\\
    x_{k-1} &= \mathrm{previous\ guess\ at\ the\ root}
\end{align*}

Approximate the first derivative with
\begin{equation*}
    f'(x_k) \approx \frac{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})}{x_k - x_{k-1}}
\end{equation*}

Substitute approximate $f'(x_k)$ into formula for Newton's method
\begin{equation*}
    x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}
\end{equation*}
to get
\begin{equation*}
    x_{k+1} = x_k - f(x_k) \left[ \frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})} \right]
\end{equation*}

\vspace{3ex}
Two versions of this formula are (equivalent in exact math)
\begin{equation*}
    x_{k+1} = x_k - f(x_k) \left[ \frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})} \right]  \tag{$\star$}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    x_{k+1} = \frac{f(x_k) x_{k-1} - f(x_{k-1}) x_k}{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})}  \tag{$\star\star$}
\end{equation*}

Equation~($\star$) is better since it is of the form $x_{k+1} = x_k + \Delta$.
Even if $\Delta$ is inaccurate the change in the estimate of the
root will be small at convergence because $f(x_k)$ will also
be small.

Equation~($\star\star$) is susceptible to catastrophic cancellation:
\vspace{0.0cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   $f(x_k)\rightarrow f(x_{k-1})$ as convergence approaches,
            so cancellation error in denominator can be large.
    \item   $|f(x)|\rightarrow 0$ as convergence approaches,
            so underflow is possible
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusions:}
\vspace{0.0cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Converges almost as quickly as Newton's method ($r\approx
1.62$).
    \item   There is no need to compute $f'(x)$.
    \item   The algorithm is simple.
    \item   Two initial guesses are necessary
    \item   Iterations are not guaranteed to stay inside an ordinal bracket.

Since
\begin{equation*}
    x_{k+1} = x_k - f(x_k) \left[ \frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})} \right]
\end{equation*}

the new guess, $x_{k+1}$, will be far from the old guess
whenever $f(x_k)\approx f(x_{k-1})$ and $|f(x)|$ is not small.

\texttt{fzero} is a hybrid method that combines bisection,
secant and reverse quadratic interpolation

\vspace{3ex}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
r = fzero('fun',x0)
r = fzero('fun',x0,options)
r = fzero('fun',x0,options,arg1,rg2,...)

\vspace{3ex}
\texttt{x0} can be a scalar or a two element vector
\begin{itemize}
    \item   If \texttt{x0} is a scalar, \texttt{fzero} tries to
            create its own bracket.
    \item   If \texttt{x0} is a two element vector, \texttt{fzero}
            uses the vector as a bracket.

\frametitle{Why (Reverse) Quadratic Interpolation?}
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f(x) = a + bx + cx^2$, and $f(x)$ has real roots, then quadratic 
interpolation gives the answer in one step.
\item Recall that Newtons's method will get the answer in one step
  only if $f(x) = a + bx$.  
\item What if $f(x) = a + bx + cx^2 \ne 0$ for any real $x$?  What
  then?
\item Instead, interpolate the inverse function: $x = g(y) = \alpha +
  \beta y + \gamma y^2$.  If $x = g(y)$, then the root is $x = g(0) =
  \alpha$.
\item What can still go wrong?

    \item   Result of secant step if RQI fails, and if the result of secant
            method is in inside the current bracket.
    \item   Result of bisection step if both RQI and secant method fail
            to produce guesses inside the current bracket.
